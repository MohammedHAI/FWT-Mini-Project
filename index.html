            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                Hi, my name is Mohammed Al-Islam. I am a student currently studying BSc Computer Science at <em>Queen Mary University.</em>
                <br/><br/>
                I'm quite passionate about programming, having dabbled in various languages such as VB.Net, Python, Java and C#. I also have experience with basic front-end development, that being with HTML and CSS.
                <br/><br/>
                Things that really interest me are game development and computer graphics. In terms of projects, I've made a few GUI applications here and there but not really started on anything major.
                <br/><br/>
                Outside of that I enjoy playing badminton and reading up on developments in technologies such as artificial intelligence, even if I don't plan to go down that route.
