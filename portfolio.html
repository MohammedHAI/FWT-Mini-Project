                Here are some personal projects that I have worked on independently. Provided is some evidence of my work.

                    <td class="project-description">
                        This was a project I worked on in my free time. I used the unity game engine to create a simple 3D platformer, with the game logic programmed in C#.
                        <br/><br/>
                        It is not finished yet as it took me a few years of developing on and off, but I learned that I could simply come back to it whenever I felt I have learned a bit more.
                        <br/><br/>
                        I was initially going to scrap the project because it was cumbersome to implement a working camera controller, but I left it and spent some time away from the project so I could learn what I needed to.
                        <br/><br/>
                        As a result, I came back more prepared and was able to eventually write my own script, rather than copying code I found online that did not satisfy my needs.

                        This was a project I created for my A-Level Computer Science NEA (Non-Exam Assessment). I used Visual Studio to create a virtual computer in the form of a GUI application, written in VB.NET.
                        <br/><br/>
                        This was the project where I learned the importance of planning, documentation and time-management as the development of the project took place over around 6 months.

                    <td class="project-description">
                        I made this mini-project for my Prodecural Programming coursework at University. It is a simple chatbot program that talks to the user and responds to them, written in Java.
                        <br/><br/>
                        All output takes place in the command line interface. The chatbot remembers things that the user says and mentions them in conversations, and depending on what the user says or has previously said, it will respond differently.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Overall the project was a good way for me to practice Java programming, especially concepts like file I/O and search algorithms.
